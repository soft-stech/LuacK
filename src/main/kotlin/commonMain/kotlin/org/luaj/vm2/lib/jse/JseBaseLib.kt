/**
 * Subclass of [BaseLib] and [LibFunction] which implements the lua basic library functions
 * and provides a directory based [ResourceFinder] as the [Globals.finder].
 *
 *
 * Since JME has no file system by default, [BaseLib] implements
 * [ResourceFinder] using [Class.getResource].
 * The [JseBaseLib] implements [Globals.finder] by scanning the current directory
 * first, then falling back to   [Class.getResource] if that fails.
 * Otherwise, the behavior is the same as that of [BaseLib].
 *
 *
 * Typically, this library is included as part of a call to
 * [org.luaj.vm2.lib.jse.JsePlatform.standardGlobals]
 * <pre> `Globals globals = JsePlatform.standardGlobals();
 * globals.get("print").call(LuaValue.valueOf("hello, world"));
` *  </pre>
 *
 *
 * For special cases where the smallest possible footprint is desired,
 * a minimal set of libraries could be loaded
 * directly via [Globals.load] using code such as:
 * <pre> `Globals globals = new Globals();
 * globals.load(new JseBaseLib());
 * globals.get("print").call(LuaValue.valueOf("hello, world"));
` *  </pre>
 *
 * However, other libraries such as *PackageLib* are not loaded in this case.
 *
 *
 * This is a direct port of the corresponding library in C.
